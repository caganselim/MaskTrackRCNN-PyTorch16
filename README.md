# MaskTrackRCNN for video instance segmentation

This repo contains fixes for MaskTrackRCNN paper to make it compatible on PyTorch 1.6+.

## Introduction
This repo serves as the official code release of the MaskTrackRCNN model for video instance segmentation described in the tech report:

```
In this work, a new task video instance segmentation is presented. Video instance segmentation extends the image instance segmentation task from the image domain to the video domain. The new problem aims at **simultaneous detection, segmentation and tracking** of object instances in videos.
YouTubeVIS, a new dataset tailored for this task is collected based on the current largest video object segmentation dataset [YouTubeVOS](youtube-vos.org). Sample annotations of a video clip can be seen below.

We also proposed an algorithm to jointly detect, segment, and track object instances in a video, named MaskTrackRCNN.  A tracking head is added to the original MaskRCNN model to match objects across frames. An overview of the algorithm is shown below.

## Installation
This repo is built based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) commit hash `f3a939f`. Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the library.
You also need to install a customized [COCO API](https://github.com/youtubevos/cocoapi) for YouTubeVIS dataset.
You can use following commands to create conda env with all dependencies.
```
conda create -n MaskTrackRCNN -y
conda activate MaskTrackRCNN
conda install -c pytorch pytorch=0.4.1 torchvision cuda92 -y
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit-dev=9.2 opencv -y
conda install cython -y
pip install git+https://github.com/youtubevos/cocoapi.git#"egg=pycocotools&subdirectory=PythonAPI"
bash compile.sh
pip install .
```
You may also need to follow [#1](/../../issues/1) to load MSCOCO pretrained models.
## Model training and evaluation
Our model is based on MaskRCNN-resnet50-FPN. The model is trained end-to-end on YouTubeVIS based on a MSCOCO pretrained checkpoint ([link](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/models/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_20181010-069fa190.pth)).
### Training
1. Download YouTubeVIS from [here](https://youtube-vos.org/dataset/vis/).
2. Symlink the train/validation dataset to `$MMDETECTION/data` folder. Put COCO-style annotations under `$MMDETECTION/data/annotations`.
```

│   │   ├── instances_val_sub.json
```

3. Run `python3 tools/train.py configs/masktrack_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_youtubevos.py` to train the model.
For reference to arguments such as learning rate and model parameters, please refer to `configs/masktrack_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_youtubevos.py`

### Evaluation

Our pretrained model is available for download at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L4R2vwlXYzW0CU7wbBCNGKVLmog1Sz2R/view?usp=sharing).
Run the following command to evaluate the model on YouTubeVIS.
```
python3 tools/test_video.py configs/masktrack_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_youtubevos.py [MODEL_PATH] --out [OUTPUT_PATH] --eval segm
```
A json file containing the predicted result will be generated as `OUTPUT_PATH.json`. YouTubeVIS currently only allows evaluation on the codalab server. Please upload the generated result to [codalab server](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20128) to see actual performances.
